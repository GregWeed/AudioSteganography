# AudioSteganography
Cyber Security project from a course last semester.



Feel free to embed whatever you like as long as its UTF-8 encoded.  Tom Sawyer and Red Barchetta by Rush are the .wav files I used when testing.  
Just note that Red Barchetta is the largest file that I have tested when embedding a file (inside the .wave file), 
I set its size as the maximum to embed within to avoid heap overflows.  

Everything works appropriately on my Mac, no file paths are included for a specific system, as I ran everything from
the project folder.  I would include files that you could use for testing but I dont want to run into any copyright issues, feel free to choose your own, 
just note that you may be asked to use a smaller file (to embed) if you are using one thats too large for the chosen wave file.

Let me know if you have any questions: weed12@live.marshall.edu 

Thanks
